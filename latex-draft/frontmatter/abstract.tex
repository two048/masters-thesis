\textit{This thesis explores the advancements and challenges in the field of machine translation, with a specific focus on translating legal texts within the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The study evaluates two prominent neural machine translation (NMT) systems, Google Translate and Azure Translate, comparing their performance in translating Hindi IPC sections into English. Data was collected from official legislative sources and processed using Python on Google Colab, with translations assessed through both automated metrics (BLEU and ROUGE scores) and human evaluation. The results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each system, offering insights into the efficacy of current NMT technologies in handling complex legal language. The findings underscore the importance of continuous development in machine translation to improve accuracy and fluency, particularly for resource-scarce languages and syntactically diverse language pairs.}
